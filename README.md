# GooglePlayMusicAPI: An unofficial .NET Google Play Music API

This is a C# port of [gmusicapi](https://github.com/simon-weber/gmusicapi).

Many thanks to the following projects from which my implementation borrows heavily:
- [gmusicapi](https://github.com/simon-weber/gmusicapi)
- [gpsoauth](https://github.com/simon-weber/gpsoauth)
- [gpsoauthsharp](https://github.com/vemacs/GPSOAuthSharp)
- [GoogleMusicAPI.NET](https://github.com/taylorfinnell/GoogleMusicAPI.NET)
- [MBGmusicSync](https://github.com/leoedin/MBGmusicSync)

# Warnings
Use of this is a violation of Google Play Music's [Terms of Service](https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/about/play-terms.html). Use at your own risk.

This is not supported or endorsed by Google.  If Google decides to change their APIs, it could break the functionality of this library with no guarantee that it will be repaired. This is also in Alpha and not well tested, as I wrote it for my own personal use.


# Usage
View the GooglePlayMusicClientExample project for examples how to use the library.

# Nuget
Nuget package available at https://www.nuget.org/packages/GooglePlayMusicAPI
